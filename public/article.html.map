Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit is the first known version (\"Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it\"). It was found by Richard McClintock, a philologist, director of publications at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia; he searched for citings of consectetur in classical Latin literature, a term of remarkably low frequency in that literary corpus.\r\n                    p\r\n                        | Cicero famously orated against his political opponent Lucius Sergius Catilina. Occasionally the first Oration against Catiline is taken for type specimens: Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus nos eludet? (How long, O Catiline, will you abuse our patience? And for how long will that madness of yours mock us?)\r\n                    p\r\n                        |\r\n                    p\r\n                        | Cicero's version of Liber Primus (first Book), sections 1.10.32–3 (fragments included in most Lorem Ipsum variants in red):\r\n                    p\r\n                        | Cicero writing letters; from an early edition by Hieronymus Scotus Sed ut perspiciatis, unde omnis iste natus error sit\r\n                        | In 1985 Aldus Corporation launched its first desktop publishing program Aldus PageMaker for Apple Macintosh computers, released in 1987 for PCs running Windows 1.0. Both contained the variant lorem ipsum most common today. Laura Perry, then art director with Aldus, modified prior versions of Lorem Ipsum text from typographical specimens; in the 1960s and 1970s it appeared often in lettering catalogs by Letraset. Anecdotal evidence has it that Letraset used Lorem ipsum already from 1970 onwards, eg. for grids (page layouts) for ad agencies. Many early desktop publishing programs, eg. Adobe PageMaker, used it to create template.\r\n                    p\r\n                        | Most text editors like MS Word or Lotus Notes generate random lorem text when needed, either as pre-installed module or plug-in to be added. Word selection or sequence don't necessarily match the original, which is intended to add variety. Presentation software like Keynote or Pages use it as a samples for screenplay layout. Content management software as Joomla, Drupal, Mambo, PHP-Nuke, WordPress, or Movable Type offer Lorem Ipsum plug-ins with the same functionality\r\n\r\n            .col-md-4\r\n                include modules/_sidebar\r\n    .container\r\n        .row\r\n            section.related-posts.clearfix\r\n                .col-md-4\r\n                    img(src=\"images/mainsrticle1.jpg\")\r\n                .col-md-4\r\n                    img(src=\"images/mainsrticle2.jpg\")\r\n                .col-md-4\r\n                    img(src=\"images/mainsrticle3.jpg\")\r\n"],"file":"article.html"}
